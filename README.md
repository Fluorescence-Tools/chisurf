# ChiSurf

ChiSurf is a software package for the global analysis of fluorescence data. It enables users to interlink, optimize, and jointly sample variables of models for time-resolved single-molecule and ensemble fluorescence experiments. By introducing dependencies across models, ChiSurf allows for the construction of complex descriptions across multiple datasets.
For a detailed explanation of the methods and implementation, please refer to the [ChiSurf Manuscript](https://doi.org/10.3390/spectroscj3020016).

## üìñ Citation

If you use ChiSurf in your research, please cite the following publication:

[https://doi.org/10.3390/spectroscj3020016\:contentReference\[oaicite:20\]{index=20}](https://doi.org/10.3390/spectroscj3020016:contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20})

This paper provides an in-depth overview of ChiSurf's capabilities, including its support for multiple fluorescence techniques such as time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC), fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), and single-molecule F√∂rster resonance energy transfer (smFRET). It also discusses the software's approach to global analysis, model generation, data visualization, and parameter sampling ([MDPI][2]).
