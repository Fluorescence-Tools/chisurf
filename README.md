# ChiSurf

ChiSurf is a software package for the analysis of complex fluorescence data
acquired in time-resolved single-molecule
and ensemble fluorescence experiments. The main feature of ChiSurf is the
joint (global) analysis of multiple datasets.

## History

The original of ChiSurfs was to estimate errors of model parameters of
fluorescence intensity decays in
Förster-resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments for FRET-driven structural
models of protein and other
biological macromolecules. It started as a collection of python scripts. With
time more features were added, e.g.,
the analysis of correlation curves, correlation of time-tagged-time resolved
(TTTR) data. A graphical user interface
makes these scripts and tools available for users without programming experience.
Overall, ChiSurf is highly experimental and its core is still heavily
refactored. Consequently, features, which worked
in old versions, may be not supported in newer versions, unless users
explicitly demand these functions.

## Features
