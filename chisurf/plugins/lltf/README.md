# LLTF: Lazy Lifetime Analysis Plugin

This plugin provides tools for analyzing fluorescence lifetime data using the LLTF module. It implements advanced 
fitting procedures for extracting fluorescence lifetimes from time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) 
measurements.

## Features

- Load and analyze TCSPC data
- Fit decay curves with multiple exponential components
- Automatic determination of an optimal number of lifetime components
- Convolution with instrument response function (IRF)
- Background estimation and correction
- IRF shift estimation and correction
- Pile-up correction
- Visualization of fits and residuals
- Export results for further analysis

## Overview

Fluorescence lifetime analysis is a powerful technique for investigating the molecular environment and dynamics of 
fluorophores. The LLTF (Lazy Lifetime Analysis) plugin simplifies this complex analysis by providing automated 
procedures for fitting fluorescence decay curves while accounting for various experimental factors.

The "lazy" approach refers to the plugin's ability to automatically handle many aspects of the analysis that would 
otherwise require manual intervention, such as determining the optimal number of lifetime components, estimating 
background levels, and correcting for IRF shifts and pile-up effects.

Ideal for extracting detailed information about fluorophore environments and dynamics from time-resolved fluorescence 
experiments, this plugin makes advanced lifetime analysis accessible to researchers with varying levels of expertise 
in fluorescence spectroscopy.

## Requirements

- Python packages:
  - PyQt5
  - numpy
  - scipy
  - matplotlib
  - lmfit (for fitting algorithms)

## Usage

1. Launch the plugin from the ChiSurf menu: Tools > Lazy Lifetime Analysis
2. Load TCSPC data:
   - Import decay curves
   - Load instrument response function (IRF)
3. Configure analysis parameters:
   - Set fitting model (number of components or automatic determination)
   - Define time range for analysis
   - Configure background handling
   - Set IRF shift parameters
4. Run the analysis
5. Visualize and evaluate results:
   - Fitted decay curves
   - Residuals
   - Lifetime component values and amplitudes
   - Quality of fit metrics
6. Export results for further analysis or reporting

## Applications

- Characterization of fluorophore environments
- Investigation of molecular dynamics and conformational changes
- Analysis of fluorescence quenching processes
- Study of energy transfer mechanisms
- Discrimination between different molecular species
- Quality control of fluorescent probes
- Monitoring of binding events and protein interactions

## Theory

Fluorescence decay curves are typically modeled as a sum of exponential components:
I(t) = ∑ αᵢ exp(-t/τᵢ)

Where:
- I(t) is the fluorescence intensity at time t
- αᵢ is the amplitude of the ith component
- τᵢ is the lifetime of the ith component

The plugin performs convolution of this model with the instrument response function to account for the finite time 
resolution of the measurement:
I_measured(t) = IRF(t) ⊗ I(t)

Additional corrections for background, pile-up effects, and IRF shifts are applied to improve the accuracy of the 
extracted lifetime parameters.
