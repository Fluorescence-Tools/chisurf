FCS Merger

This plugin provides a graphical interface for merging multiple fluorescence
correlation spectroscopy (FCS) curves. Features include:

- Loading and visualization of multiple correlation curves
- Averaging of correlation data with proper weighting
- Statistical analysis of merged data
- Export of merged correlation curves for further analysis

The merger is useful for improving signal-to-noise ratio in FCS experiments by
combining data from multiple measurements.
