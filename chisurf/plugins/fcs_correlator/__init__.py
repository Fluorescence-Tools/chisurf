FCS Correlator

This plugin provides a wizard interface for correlating and merging fluorescence 
correlation spectroscopy (FCS) data. Features include:

- Selection and filtering of TTTR (Time-Tagged Time-Resolved) photon data
- Calculation of correlation functions with configurable parameters
- Merging of multiple correlation curves for improved signal-to-noise ratio
- Export of correlation results for further analysis

The correlator is essential for analyzing molecular dynamics and diffusion 
processes in fluorescence correlation spectroscopy experiments.
