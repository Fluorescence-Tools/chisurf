However, for later frames direct usage of the Otsu threshold selected too much of background, thus we slightly increase the threshold by multiplying with 1.03 (Otsu_scaling_factor) In the final steps, first small holes inside the cytoplasm area are closed, followed by the removal of small detected areas outside the main cell. Here, a minimal size threshold of 10’000 pixel is applied."

    "Next, the nucleus is segmented. In contrast to the cytoplasm, here only the green intensity image is used as input as here the contrast between cytoplasm/vesicles region and nucleus seemed largest. Please note that the nucleus can be best seen as “region in cytoplasm but without vesicles”. The segmentation of the nucleus thus proves to be a challenge. We first apply a Gaussian smoothing with a radius of 2 sigma, followed by thresholding using the method of Li. The thresholded image is dilated, holes inside the nucleus filled and small areas outside removed. Next all left-overs outside the cytoplasmic (i.e. body of the cell) are removed by multiplying with the generated cytoplasm mask, followed by another round of dilation to make the nucleus “smoother”. Finally, as the nucleus is characterized by being outside the way of the diffusing vesicles, we average the such obtained nucleus and generate an average nucleus by summing over all 400 frames and threshold this projection using the method of Otsu."
