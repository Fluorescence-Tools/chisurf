Feedback
========

The best way to report a bug or request is to contact me personally. Just
pass by in my office and we can try to reproduce the bug. Right now ChiSURF
is not stable. Therefore it is not officially released in the internet.

If you want to contribute the best thing you can do is writing user-documentations,
examples and tutorials.
